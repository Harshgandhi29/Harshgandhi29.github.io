# Experience

### Swimming Instructor

##### Making Waves Swim School / Brampton /2017-2019
Taught children aged 2-12 years old how to swim and situational based lifesaving skills
- Wrote well-polished report cards for students
- Communicate with their parents regarding any of their concerns
- Responsible for the students for the duration of the session

### Mailing Bot

##### IMAP, EMAIL, Pyfirmata, Tkinter, pyttsx3 and other libraries
Works with an Arduino to set up a notification system every time a new email is received from a specific address. It has a simple applet-based UI made with Tkinter.
- Reads the messages/emails out loud in English
- Translates messages into different languages for those with different backgrounds
- Uses Pyfirmata to translate the python code into C++ to send a visual alert

### Twitter Bot

##### Tweepy API
Due to the pandemics, there has been an eruption in fake news regarding covid-19. I decided to make a bot which filters through my feed and for every #coronavirus comments a link to the WHO to educate the public.
